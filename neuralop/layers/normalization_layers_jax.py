class AdaIN(nn.Module):
    """Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) layer for style transfer in neural operators.

    AdaIN performs instance normalization followed by adaptive scaling and shifting
    based on an external embedding vector. This allows for style transfer by
    modulating the output characteristics based on a conditioning signal.

    The layer first normalizes the input using instance normalization, then applies
    learned scaling (weight) and shifting (bias) parameters derived from an embedding
    vector through a multi-layer perceptron.

    Parameters
    ----------
    embed_dim : int
        Dimension of the embedding vector used for style conditioning
    in_channels : int
        Number of input channels to normalize
    mlp : nn.Module, optional
        Multi-layer perceptron that maps embedding to (weight, bias) parameters.
        Should output 2*in_channels values. If None, a default MLP is created
        with architecture: Linear(embed_dim, 512) -> GELU -> Linear(512, 2*in_channels)
    eps : float, optional
        Small value added to the denominator for numerical stability in normalization.
        Default is 1e-5.

class BatchNorm(nn.Module):

    BatchNorm normalizes data across the entire batch, computing a single mean
    and standard deviation for all samples combined. This is the most common
    form of normalization and is effective when batch statistics are a good
    approximation of the overall data distribution.

    For dimensions > 3, the layer automatically flattens spatial dimensions
    and uses BatchNorm, as high-dimensional batch norm requires flattening.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_dim : int
        Spatial dimension of input data (e.g., 1 for 1D, 2 for 2D, 3 for 3D).
        Determined by FNOBlocks.n_dim. If n_dim > 3, spatial dimensions are
        flattened before applying batch norm.
    num_features : int
        Number of channels in the input tensor to be normalized
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional parameters to pass to the underlying batch normalization layer.
        Common parameters include:
        - eps : float, optional
            Small value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
            Default is 1e-5.
        - momentum : float, optional
            Value used for the running_mean and running_var computation.
            Default is 0.1.
        - use_bias : bool, optional
            If True, apply learnable bias. Default is True.
