        Typical usecases are:

        * Your upsample or downsample the input in the Spectral conv: the skip connection has to be similarly scaled.
          This allows you to deal with it however you want (e.g. avoid aliasing)
        * You perform a change of basis in your Spectral Conv, again, this needs to be applied to the skip connection too.
